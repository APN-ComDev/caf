                    With the recommendation that APN continues to produce synthesis materials of the work
                    it conducts under the core programmes and frameworks, a special publication project is
                    targeted explicitly to outputs from the CAF. The joint activity between APN Secretariat
                    and <a href="https://www.slycantrust.org/">SLYCAN Trust</a> will develop a special publication for the approximately 14 completed
                    APN projects related to climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and
                    loss and damage.

                    The outputs will be especially beneficial for the global agendas of UNFCCC
                    Paris Agreement (PA), the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)
                    and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR).
